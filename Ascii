our challenge is crypto 


I got a new hard drive just to hold my flag, but I'm afraid that it rotted. What do I do? The only thing I could get off of it was this:
 01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101

We don't know what kind of code it is. We have to copy the code.
 
our code is 
01000011010101000100011001111011010000100110100101110100010111110100011001101100011010010111000001110000011010010110111001111101

We first need to analyze this code, what kind of code it is.

yes we got it.

this is Ascii Code

we have to decode the code. 
tools:https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code

we have the flag : CTF{Bit_Flippin}
