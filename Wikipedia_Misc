Our Wikipedia Misc challenge is here

Not much to go off here, 
but itâ€™s all you need: 
Wikipedia and 128.125.52.138.

and the solve is here

1. First of all, I tried directly 
searching for the given IP Address, 
but that path led to nowhere. So next, 
I went to https://www.wikipedia.org/ 
to get answers. I tried to search given 
IP Address to search their database. 


2. Upon searching the given domain, 
I get this search result, so I try 
to check up some links there.


3. When I tried the first link of 
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php
?title=Flag&diff=prev&oldid=676540540, 
I got the flag there



our flag is OP{cNi76bV2IVERlh97hP}
