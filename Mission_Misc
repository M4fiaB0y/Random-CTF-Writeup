Ambush Mission

Hi, i can't tell you my name since now i'm in a mission. In case to arrest our fugitive target, our team had been intercepted communication between the target with his fellow and found this image (https://mega.nz/#!TKZ3DabY!BEUHD7VJvq_b-M22eD4VfHv_PPBnW2m7CZUfMbveZYw). It looks like they are going to meet in specific place, but we still don't know the time yet. Can you help me?



The main idea of finding the flag is Stego and Crypto skills.

Step-1:
After I downloaded clue.png, I checked for basic commands like strings, binwalk, etc.


Step-2:
Now, I used Stegsolve tools(https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools/tree/master/stegsolve) to check for any hints.

Step-3:
Luckily, in Red Plane 0, I got encrypted string: ==QTh9lMx8Fd08VZt9FdFNTb.

If you have slight idea of Base64 encrypted strings, they end with = or ==. So, this string was clearly reversed.

Step-4:
I reversed it online at: https://codebeautify.org/reverse-string

Step-5:
Finally again Base64. Looked small. Hoped it would be flag.

Step-6:
Finally, the flag becomes: flag{m3Et_me_4t_12_aM}
